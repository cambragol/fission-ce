# fpattern

Fallout 2 uses `fpattern` v1.07 (see `0x4EB990`) to find entries in .DAT files. The closest version I was able to find is v1.08 on the author's website ([fpattern.c](http://david.tribble.com/src/fpattern.c), [fpattern.h](http://david.tribble.com/src/fpattern.h)). It's not very safe to use such direct links, and I'm not sure if it's possible to download these files via `FetchContent`. Luckily there is a newer v1.9 on [GitHub](https://github.com/Loadmaster/fpattern).
